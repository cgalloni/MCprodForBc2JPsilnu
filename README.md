# MCprodForBc2JPsilnu

Please see "run_local.sh" in each year of the production,
to see the sequence of the production. 

To produce the sample, you can do (in each directory)

> sh run_local.sh [sample_name] [index] [input_gridpack] [# of events to be produced] [random seed]

This script starts from gridpack, and then produce up to nanoAOD. 
So there are several places to be changed to start from LHE up to miniAOD. But basic configuration settings are there.
